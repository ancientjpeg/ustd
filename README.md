# Î¼std - Jackson's Micro Standard Library

This is a collection of helpers classes that I've made that feel reusable enough to be kept in a central repository. The goal is to have each helper class be self-contained in at most one header or one header and one implementation file, so that including it in your project doesn't involve adding this library as a dependency.
